# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to set up Visual Studio Code and Git for version control.  
I created a GitHub repository, committed files, and learned how to push changes.  
I also worked with branches, merged changes, and observed how Git tracks file additions and deletions.  
Overall, this lab improved my understanding of Git workflows and collaborative development.
